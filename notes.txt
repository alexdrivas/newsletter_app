Hi I have some additional ideas for the mvp dev plan. I will share them to you help me formulate and organize them 



def subscription_router(user_subscriptions):
    """

"""


## Once assumption I am making is that i can use MIMETEXT to format data for an email. then return that data in a dict to use in a subsequent sending of that HTML formated text. Idont know if that is beyond limitations of MIMETEXT. 
My overall concept is, a subscription is a data pipeline the user is asking for. we fufill the request by checking if the data is already in our database, else making api calls to receive the data save the data, then return the data to the user. In this version we are sending the data by email, so i want to HTML format the data fir each subscription so i can have continuity and design the best formatting for differnt data susbscriptions. 
so after the data is internaly obtained, we send the data into functions that format the data with HTML and then retrn HTML formated data. we apply header and footer to the email and then compose the email. 


in the future there will be user defined prefrences on the subscriptiuon that curates the subsctition to them, but for now we will do without these user prefrences. In the user object there is a attribute subscriptions wich is a nested dict of the datapipelines subscribed to by the user. 
The start fothe send newletter route queries the first user in the data base (for simplicity), calls subscription router on the user's subscriptions to determine if the data already exists in the db or if the data needs to be fetched. if True, it returns data for each subscription in a nested dict. If a subsciption data is not in the db, the router calls functions that make api calls to retreive the data, saves the data to the db and returns the data. 

we start formatting the data in preperation for emailign the user. 
Once all the subscription data is obtained it is sent into email_engine() which Routes the subscription data to numerous functions that return HTML formatted data each known as an email_subscription container. The functions use mimetext to format. It is done this way to make each subscription modular during development.  Then headers and footers are added. the email is then composed and sent to that user. 




one example of a subscription is weather_today. the objective is to return quality information tothe user on the weather today such as high and low, weather description based on the users's location. 



let me know what you think of this strategy for obtainign results for the user's subscription, saving results for reuse, and containerizing HTML formatted emails to display the data to the user. The goall for now is to launch an mvp with the email method, later i wil do a web app or a mobile app sp backend is more important than front enf for now. 


News JSON from API . Need to wrap this in

do you think this is a good format? 

the resukt is a jason so we can parse and see if the subscripn has the required result attributes we need to fufil the user prefrences. 

can you prvide me with python for the models with sqlalchemy. 

provide sample data to put into these for 5 rows





your second task,

 examine subscription router. write a function that we can call in subscription router to check if the weatherupdate nowfunction is present in our db and fetch it. the call should include the user defined criteria like lication and units.  we will call the db in the router function
